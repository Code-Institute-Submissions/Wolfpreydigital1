BUILD AN ISSUE TRACKER
•	The primary entity in the Issue Tracker is a ticket describing a user’s issue, and similar to Github’s issue tracker, you should allow users to create tickets, comment on tickets, and show the status of the ticket (e.g. ‘to do,’ ‘doing,’ or ‘done’). As mentioned, issues come in two varieties – ‘bugs’ (which you’ll fix for free, eventually), and ‘features’ which you’d only develop if you’re offered enough money. To help you prioritize your work, your users will be able to upvote bugs (signifying ‘I have this too’), and upvote feature requests (signifying ‘I want to have this too’). While upvoting bugs is free, to upvote a feature request, users would need to pay some money (with a minimum amount of your choice) to pay for your time in working on it. In turn, you promise always to spend at least 50% of your time working on developing the highest-paid feature.
•	To offer transparency to your users, you decide to create a page that contains some graphs showing how many bugs or features are tended to on a daily, weekly and monthly basis, as well as the highest-voted bugs and features.
•	Add any additional pages that would help you attract users to the Issue Tracker (and have them pay you well). To make the users participate as much as possible in your online community, make sure that your UI/UX is sublime. Feel free to add additional features, such as a blog, extra perks for active participants, etc.
•	If you want to have some more fun with this, feel free also to add pages describing your fictional UnicornAttractor application.
•	And of course, as this project is going to be the lifeblood of your company, it’s essential that new developers that join the company will be able to get up and running as quickly as possible. Documentation is the best way to achieve this.


The aim of this project was to great a brand approach to this issue tracker website. A great website, great service, outstanding developers but if the brand is memorable,creative and stands out then users will must likely go else.
I came up with the concept of the wolves as they are most likely animal (character) to scent danger, bugs and capture species in a fast time with little fuss.
The front page is slick, professional, stunning images and simple, but also highlighting the brand. The user experience in the home page is easy, simple, not difficult to navigate and no jargon which other competitors have which is a negative.
The other pages are more simplistic and less content but more call to actions, and inceptives to sign up. Overall I am happy how the website has turned out.

Components


D3.js: D3.js is a JavaScript library for manipulating documents based on data. D3 helps you bring data to life using HTML, SVG, and CSS. D3’s emphasis on web standards gives you the full capabilities of modern browsers without tying yourself to a proprietary framework, combining powerful visualization components and a data-driven approach to DOM manipulation.
Crossfilter.js: Crossfilter is a JavaScript library for exploring large multivariate datasets in the browser. 


DC.js: is a javascript charting library with native crossfilter support, allowing highly efficient exploration on large multi-dimensional datasets (inspired by crossfilter's demo). It leverages d3 to render charts in CSS-friendly SVG format. Charts rendered using dc.js are data driven and reactive and therefore provide instant feedback to user interaction. dc.js is an easy yet powerful javascript library for data visualization and analysis in the browser and on mobile devices.


Flask: Flask is a micro web framework written in Python. It is classified as a microframework because it does not require particular tools or libraries. It has no database abstraction layer, form validation, or any other components where pre-existing third-party libraries provide common functions.


Queue.js: Queue.js is a simple and efficient queue implementation for JavaScript whose dequeue function runs in amortised constant time. As a result, for larger queues it can be significantly faster than using arrays.


MongoDB: MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program. Classified as a NoSQL database program, MongoDB uses JSON-like documents with schemata.


JQuery:jQuery is a JavaScript library designed to simplify HTML DOM tree traversal and manipulation, as well as event handling, CSS animation, and Ajax.

Languages
Html: Hypertext Markup Language is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.

CSS: Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML. CSS is a cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.
             
             CSS framework Bootstrap: Bootstrap is a free and open-source front-end web framework. It contains HTML and CSS-based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, navigation and other interface components, as well as optional JavaScript extensions.

Javascript: JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language that conforms to the ECMAScript specification. It is a programming language that is characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm. 


Python: Python is an interpreted, high-level, general-purpose programming language.



Testing and errors
I had problems with testing apps in pyhton and django, but the more exposure i got from fixing errors, bad syntax and just going away from code for a couple of hours and coming back fresh, that when my app testing got much better.
